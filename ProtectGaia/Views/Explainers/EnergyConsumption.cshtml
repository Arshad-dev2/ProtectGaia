                                Talking on a global level, Energy consumption is one of the main contributors of the green house gases.
                                These greenhouse gases are the main reasons our world is experiencing the climate change.
                                Talking of Australia, the energy which constitutes of electricity or natural gas is mainly generated by the power plants which runs on coal.
                                These coal powered plants generate a very high amount of carbon, methane and other harmful Green house gases which adversely effect our climate.

                                Not only energy as a whole, but household energy inefficiency and wastage also account for a very large chunk of these emissions.
                                We all are unaware that our day to day household activities leads to wastage in energy and releases very significant amount of green house gases.

                                Uses of natural gases and Hydrofluorocarbons in Air conditioners, Refrigerators, Inverters and Heating systems, they all contribute indirectly leading
                                to excess emissions of these poisonous gases in our atmosphere.
                                To top it all, it also leads to wastage of many resources such as water and electricity.
                                If each and every one of us taps our day to day habits and activities,
                                we all can make a difference and drive our future generations towards a greener earth.
                                The Infographic provided suggests some ways to reduce household emissions.

                            “Australia's households are responsible for around 12 per cent of total Green house emissions”.<br/>
                            (Source – Australian Government – Department of Industry, Science and Energy Resources).

                            It is not that we together as a community are helpless, we all can contribute heavily in reducing these emissions.
                            If we all follow the steps discussed above in the infographic, we can make an impact towards carbon emissions that are generated by the household energy.
