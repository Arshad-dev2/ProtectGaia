                        It is not just Energy and Electricity emissions that have been causing problems for Australia,
                        but <strong>inefficient and poor standards of transport sector have made this sector the third largest contributor of greenhouse gases</strong> in the country.
                        The Infographic below educates us about why Australia is at the back of the pack:

                        The transport sector includes Trucks, Buses, Public and Private vehicles.
                        Transport emissions are a very high concern for the country because of its high growth rate.
                        For Australia, this sector is not good as it is not efficient on the international level.
                        High usage of personal vehicles leads to even more emissions of these greenhouse gases.

                        Some of the reasons for Australia's bad transport sector can be well understood from the diagram below:

                                        With no action, transport emissions are expected to reach 111 MtCO2 by 2030.”<br />

                        If no measures are taken, this problem will increase at an alarming rate
                        and cause even more effects to our environment and human health.
                        With many solutions available to counter this issue we can tap on these emissions.

                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        Using Public transport often would reduce high usage of private vehicles on Australian
                        roads and would help in reducing carbon emissions altogether.<br /><br />
                        Drifting towards healthier practices such as <strong><i style="color: #008080">cycling, jogging and walking to smaller distances</i></strong>
                        would also be a very viable action in fighting climate change and would also be very good for your health.
                        Slowly and steadily we can win this race against greenhouse emissions.
