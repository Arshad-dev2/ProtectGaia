                It is not just Energy and Electricity emissions that have been causing problems for Australia,
                but inefficient and poor standards of transport sector have made this sector the second largest
                contributor of greenhouse gases in the country. The Infographic below educates us about why
                Australia is at the back of the pack:

                The transport sector includes Trucks, Buses, Public and Private vehicles.
                Transport emissions are a very high concern for the country because of its high growth rate.
                For Australia, this sector is not good as it is not efficient on the international level.
                High usage of personal vehicles leads to even more emissions of these greenhouse gases.

                            Transport emissions have the highest rate of growth of any sector since 1990.
                            With no action, transport emissions are expected to reach 111 MtCO2 by 2030.

                    If no measures are taken, this problem will increase at an alarming rate
                    and cause even more effects to our environment and human health.
                    With many solutions available to counter this issue we can tap on these emissions.
                    Using Public transport often would reduce high usage of private vehicles on Australian
                    roads and would help in reducing carbon emissions altogether. Drifting towards  healthier
                    practices such as cycling, jogging and walking to smaller distances would also be a very
                    viable action in fighting climate change and would also be very good for your health.
                    Assess your vehicles emission standards checked and try to switch to electric alternatives.
                    Slowly and steadily we can win this  race against greenhouse emissions.
